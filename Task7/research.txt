Constructors are special methods that run automatically when an object is created. They help by:

1. Object Initialization

Constructors give objects valid starting values so they are ready to use immediately.

2. Code Reliability

They prevent uninitialized or invalid objects, reducing runtime errors.

3. Maintainability

All initialization logic is in one place, making the code easier to update and manage.

Real-World Uses

Initializing game characters with name, level, and health

Setting up API or database connections

Creating orders in e-commerce with customer and item details




Encapsulation means protecting data by keeping fields private and exposing them only through methods.
It improves security, prevents incorrect changes, and keeps code organized.

Classes & Objects

A class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance of that blueprint.

Examples of Encapsulation

A BankAccount class hides the balance and allows only deposit/withdraw through methods.

A Student class hides marks and validates them before storing.
